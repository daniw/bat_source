For the use of this document several points should be noted:

\begin{itemize}
\item Manufacturing/soldering steps are noted in \textcolor{green}{green}
\item It is expected for the steps to be done from top to bottom.
\item For measurements where polarity is relevant (including resistance measurements), the connection for the positive probe is noted first.
\item For the expected resistance values it was assumed that no current will flow into any semiconductors the actual values might be lower. Consider the test passed when the measured value seems reasonable.
\item All current values are only estimates. The measured value might differ substantially. Consider the test passed when the measured value is either below the expected value or can be considered safe.
\item Tests where the description is marked with a asterisk (*) can be considered optional when time is critical.

\end{itemize}
