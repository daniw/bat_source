\subsection{Charging}
The user must be able to recharge the interated energy source. Multiple concepts are discussed: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrated power supply with mains connector
        \\
        The device is connected to mains for charging. The integrated power supply provides the protective insulation. 
    \item Charging through output plugs
        \\
        A DC voltage is applied to the output pins when the device is switched of, which powers the charger. No insulation is necessary, because no electrically conductive parts are exposed. 
    \item Wireless charging
        \\
        The charger is powered with an alternating magnetic field that is applied from outside the device enclosure, similar to Qi chargers for phones. This might lead to a increased heat output when charging inside the storage enclosure. 
    \item External power supply with integrated charger
        \\
        An external power supply supplies the device with power for charging. This design might require a protective insulation on the charging input or output port, depending on the selected connector type. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User interface}
The user must be able to set the operation mode and adjust the output current. The output voltage and current should be shown to the user. 

\subsubsection{User interaction}
\begin{itemize}
     \item Touch control
        \\
        Multiple touch sensors can be implemented that can be actuated through the enclosure. No tactile feedback is provided unless an additional actuator is implemented. 
    \item Hall sensors with external magnet
        \\
    \item Buttons / switches
        \\
        The buttons / switches must include ingress protection
    \item Rotary encoder
        \\
        A rotary encoder with integrated push-button can be used. This solution will provide feedback to the user. The encoder must include ingress protection for water. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Display type}
\begin{itemize}
     \item 7-segment
        \\
    \item 13-segment
        \\
    \item Alphanumeric
        \\
    \item Dot marix
        \\
    \item Graphical
        \\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Display technology}
\begin{itemize}
     \item LED
        \\
    \item LCD
        \\
    \item OLED
        \\
    \item E-paper
        \\
\end{itemize}
