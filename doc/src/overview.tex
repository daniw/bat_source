\subsection{Charging}
The user must be able to recharge the interated energy source. Multiple concepts are discussed: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrated power supply with mains connector
        \\
        The device is connected to mains for charging. The integrated power supply provides the protective insulation. 
    \item Charging through output plugs
        \\
        A DC voltage is applied to the output pins when the device is switched of, which powers the charger. No insulation is necessary, because no electrically conductive parts are exposed. 
    \item Wireless charging
        \\
        The charger is powered with an alternating magnetic field that is applied from outside the device enclosure, similar to Qi chargers for phones. This might lead to a increased heat output when charging inside the storage enclosure. 
    \item External power supply with integrated charger
        \\
        An external power supply supplies the device with power for charging. This design might require a protective insulation on the charging input or output port, depending on the selected connector type.
